# WebOSINT üåê
**WebOSINT** is a Python script to gather (passive) domain intelligence.

<br>

  
# Requirements üêç
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Don't forget to install the requirements.txt
- You will be limited in your search requests with the Hacker Target free API, you can purchase a Hacker Target membership and your API here: (https://hackertarget.com/scan-membership/)
- For the WhoisXML API; this is an easy process and free, simply create an account and use the `trial 500 free API requests`  (Once you have used the 500 requests you will need to make a purchase, and if you don't want a yearly or monthly membership you can make one-time payments, `5000 queries for 100,00$ USD` or `1000 queries for 30,00$ USD`  :(https://whois.whoisxmlapi.com)

<br>

# Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

```
git clone https://github.com/C3n7ral051nt4g3ncy/webosint
```
  
```
cd webosint
```
 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
  
```
python3 webosint.py
```
<br>

Once the script starts, you have hardly any typing to do:
``` 
- Domain format example: google.com
- To choose between yes and no: Type Y or y for Yes  |  N or n for No
- Choose between a free search and search with your API Key: Type -F or f for the free search | Type -API or api for the search with your API keys
```  


<br>

# API Keys üîë
In the `Config.json` file, just paste your API Keys inside the quotation marks `"API Key"` (see photo below)
- It's **not an obligation** to pay for a **Hacker Target** API key, you can leave it how it is, just choose the free search by typing  `-F` each time the tool asks you to choose between the Free search and the search using your API key.
- It's an **obligation** ‚úÖ to get yourself a **WhoisXML** Api key, this is free (`500 searches free`), just go to the WhoisXML website and get an account to get your API key: (https://whois.whoisxmlapi.com)
- It's also an **obligation** ‚úÖ to get yourself a **WhoisFreaks** Api key, this is free (`100 searches free`), just go to the WhoisFreaks website and sign up to get your API key: (https://whoisfreaks.com), and by the way, once your 100 free searches are used, you can purchase 5000 API Calls for only 19,00$ USD

# Terminal Scrollback Buffer üî£
Be aware that for the reverse IP search using the Hacker Target API, you are going to get a few hundred results for some websites, make sure that your Terminal Scrollback preferences are set to `unlimited scrollback` so that you can scroll back up to see all results!

# Potential Issues and Errors ‚ùå
Before making this repository public, I gave private access to a few people, some were getting an error right at the beginning of the script and websites that were `Registered` were being shown as `Not Registered`. Found the problem/issue, some people have both `whois` and  `python-whois` modules, and they were conflicting with each other. Fixing the issue will be:
``` 
pip3 uninstall whois
```   
``` 
pip3 uninstall python-whois
``` 
Make a clean install: 
``` 
pip 3 install python-whois
```   

<br>
  
Or simply use `virtualenv` üß†
