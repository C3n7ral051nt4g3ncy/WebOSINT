<br>

Once the script starts, you have hardly any typing to do:

- It's **not an obligation** to pay for a Hacker Target API key, you can leave it how it is, just choose the free search by typing **-F** each time the tool asks you to choose between the Free search and the search using your API key.
- It's an **obligation** ‚úÖ however to get yourself a WhoisXML Api key, this is free (50 searches each month), just go to the WhoisXML website and get an account to get your API key: (https://whois.whoisxmlapi.com)

# Potential Issues and Errors ‚ùå
Before making this repository public, I gave private access to a few people, some were getting an error right at the beginning of the script and websites that were `Registered` were being shown as `Not Registered`. Found the problem/issue, some people have both `whois` and  `python-whois` modules, and they were conflicting with each other. Fixing the issue will be:
``` 
pip3 uninstall whois
```   
``` 
pip3 uninstall python-whois
``` 
Make a clean install: 
``` 
pip 3 install python-whois
```   

<br>
  
Or simply use `virtualenv` üß†
